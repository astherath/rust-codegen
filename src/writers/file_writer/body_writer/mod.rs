//! StringBuilder module that writes most of the generated code in the form of
//! the actual actix endpoint methods.
//!
//! Relies on data from `Endpoint` structs.
//!
//! Should ONLY ever be written to a file AFTER the header string has been
//! written to it (else compile will fail).
//!
//! FIXME: The name is a bit misleading, in reality it just composes the
//! output file strings without writing them. Maybe a refactor is in the works?
//! Or maybe the module should actually write to IO.
//! Worst case we can name swap between this mod and `HTTPGetEndpointBuilder`.
