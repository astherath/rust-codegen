//! ## Parser - User input cleaning and validation
//! Main input reader `mod` for the project. Reads a TOML file and parses it into a valid format for later handoff to
//! the `writer` module.

//! This module only actually reads the file data, all other operations are handled by the
//! `assembler` sibling module.
